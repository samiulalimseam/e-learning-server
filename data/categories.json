             "description": "Data scientist is one of the best suited professions to thrive this century. It is digital, programming-oriented, and analytical. Therefore, it comes as no surprise that the demand for data scientists has been surging in the job marketplace. However, supply has been very limited. It is difficult to acquire the skills necessary to be hired as a data scientist.   Universities have been slow at creating specialized data science programs. (not to mention that the ones that exist are very expensive and time consuming) Most online courses focus on a specific topic and it is difficult to understand how the skill they teach fit in the complete picture  ",
